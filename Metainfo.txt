Description: 'Performs the Unified yield curve Taylor rule in forecasting thed exchange rates, a combination of yield factors are 
tested to have the forecasting ability in forecasting the exchange rates. To fit a model with possible structural changes, we set 
several switching structures on a given dataset. The model is then used for forecasting over 3-12 monthos horizons. The input data 
are monthly observations of exchange rates and the pre-defined yield factors. Computes MAE for the forecasted values. Plots the time 
series ofthe predicted vs. observed values of exchange rates over the prediction interval.'

Keywords: 'linear model, regression, state-space model, time varying, Markov Switching, exchange rates, prediction.'
